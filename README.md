# numeri_primi

Hi everyone!
I created this project with the reason of improving my python skills, as an exercise.
The name "numeri primi" is the italian for "prime numbers", so as the name says,
this project gives you all the prime numbers from 1 to a number you want.

There are three files:

-numeri_primi.py: Once it has finished to search for prime numbers in the range, it prints them all togheter. At the end it gives you the amount of prime numbers fonud.
-numeri_primi_seq.py: as it founds a prime number, it prints it. At the end it gives you the amount of prime numbers fonud.
-numeri_primi_file.py: as it founds a prime number, it put it in a file called "numeri_primi.txt".
